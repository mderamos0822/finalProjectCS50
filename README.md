# Home Organizer App

#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/4HtN-aALTCo>

#### Description: I am creating this application to connect comsumers with our skilled professionals to clean and organize a room in their home. With this app, consumers can book their cleaning easily. We ask that they send a photo and discription of the room to get an accurate quote. Home Organizer currently serves the Los Angeles Area such as Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, and otther surrounding areas.

#### The targeted consumers are those who are far too busy to do extra cleaning and organizing in their home. We want to make their lives simpler with their busy schedule so they can come home to an organized space. We are also targeting those individuals who have a hard time throwing things away causing their room to be overcrowded. Our goal is to help our community feel like they're walking into a nice, clean home.

#### Pricing will be determined based on the size of the room and the needs of our clients. One 100 sq ft room may be $100 for our service depending on the changes we will make. Prices can go from $100 - $1000. That is why we ask for photos and descriptions through the app so get a better idea of the price.

#### Let's talk about how to use the application. A consumer will have to create a log in with a username and password. After, it will let the user click schedule cleaning. Once clicked, the user will be prompted to provide up to 5 photos of the room and a description. When this is complete, the app will let users know that a representative will be contacting them regarding the quote through email and phone call.

#### In addition to the app, we will have a community, FAQ, and About us section.
